<ul>
	<li>Second generation (supply temperature from 30°C to 60°C): Heat can be supplied directly for space heating.
		For DHW, the temperature must usually be increased, for example, using a HP.
		In order to cool the building a cooling system is required and excess heat is not reused.
		Heat losses along the network are in the range 3–7 % of heat supplied.
		Energy requested for pumping is around 1–2 % of heat supplied.
	</li>
	<li class="toinline">Third generation (supply temperature from 20°C to 30°C): Heat cannot be supplied directly for space heating
		and DHW; a HP is required. In order to cool the building, a cooling system is required,
		but the heat produced is directly injected into the network and can be reused.
		Heat losses along the network are lower than 3 % of heat supplied.
		Energy requested for pumping is around 1–2 % of heat supplied.
	</li>
	<li>Fourth generation (Supply temperature lower than 20°C): Heat cannot be supplied directly for space heating
		and DHW; a HP is required. The network temperatures could be also appropriate for direct cooling
		of the building by means of a heat exchanger (i.e. without a cooling machine). Excess heat is injected and reused.
		Heat losses along the network are negligible. Energy requested for pumping is around 2–3 % of heat supplied.

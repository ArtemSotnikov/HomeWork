		<li>Fourth generation (Supply temperature lower than 20°C): Heat cannot be supplied directly for space heating
			and DHW; a HP is required. The network temperatures could be also appropriate for direct cooling
			of the building by means of a heat exchanger (i.e. without a cooling machine). Excess heat is injected and reused.
			Heat losses along the network are negligible. Energy requested for pumping is around 2–3 % of heat supplied.

	<h1>District Heating and Cooling</h1>
	<p>
		Thermal networks are essential for the energy transition and decarbonization of the building stock.
		The integration of renewable energies into thermal networks requires a rethinking of conventional concepts.

		District Heating and Cooling Temperature Classification</h2>
	<p>
		In <strong>Figure</strong> below the classification proposed by Lund et al. has been described, to provide clear,
		unambiguous, and user-friendly descriptions for the application of 'generations' terminology.
		This classification is widely used and recognized internationally, both by academics and professionals in the field.

	<ul>
		<li>Second generation (supply temperature from 30°C to 60°C): Heat can be supplied directly for space heating.
			For DHW, the temperature must usually be increased, for example, using a HP.
			In order to cool the building a cooling system is required and excess heat is not reused.
			Heat losses along the network are in the range 3–7 % of heat supplied.
			Energy requested for pumping is around 1–2 % of heat supplied.
		</li>
		<li>Third generation (supply temperature from 20°C to 30°C): Heat cannot be supplied directly for space heating
			and DHW; a HP is required. In order to cool the building, a cooling system is required,
			but the heat produced is directly injected into the network and can be reused.
			Heat losses along the network are lower than 3 % of heat supplied.
			Energy requested for pumping is around 1–2 % of heat supplied.
		</li>
		<li>Fourth generation (Supply temperature lower than 20°C): Heat cannot be supplied directly for space heating
			and DHW; a HP is required. The network temperatures could be also appropriate for direct cooling
			of the building by means of a heat exchanger (i.e. without a cooling machine). Excess heat is injected and reused.
			Heat losses along the network are negligible. Energy requested for pumping is around 2–3 % of heat supplied.

		A digital twin is a digital model of an intended or actual real-world physical product, system, or process
		(a physical twin) that serves as the effectively indistinguishable digital counterpart of it for practical purposes,
		such as simulation, integration, testing, monitoring, and maintenance. A digital twin is set of adaptive models
		that emulate the behaviour of a physical system in a virtual system getting real time data to update itself
		along its life cycle. The digital twin replicates the physical system to predict failures and
		opportunities for changing, to prescribe real time actions for optimizing and/or mitigating unexpected events
		observing and evaluating the operating profile system. Though the concept originated earlier
		(as a natural aspect of computer simulation generally), the first practical definition of a digital twin originated
		from NASA in an attempt to improve the physical-model simulation of spacecraft in 2010.
		Digital twins are the result of continual improvement in modeling and engineering.
		In the 2010s and 2020s, manufacturing industries began moving beyond digital product definition to extending
		the digital twin concept to the entire manufacturing process. Doing so allows the benefits of virtualization
		to be extended to domains such as inventory management including lean manufacturing, machinery crash avoidance,
		tooling design, troubleshooting, and preventive maintenance. Digital twinning therefore allows extended reality
		and spatial computing to be applied not just to the product itself but also to all of the business processes
		that contribute toward its production.
